# i3wm and related X-Windows customisation

### Install i3 

```text
yum install epel-release
yum install dnf
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/admiralnemo/i3wm-el7/repo/epel-7/admiralnemo-i3wm-el7-epel-7.repo
```

This will add a new repo that you can see defined at /etc/yum.repos.d/admiralnemo-i3wm-el7-epel-7.repo 
 
Now you can do:

```text
yum install dejavu-sans-fonts dejavu-sans-mono-fonts dejavu-serif-fonts i3 i3status lilyterm
```


### High DPI

Create .Xresources and .profile as specified here: https://dougie.io/linux/hidpi-retina-i3wm/

More mouse accelleration is desirable: xinput set-prop 15 352 0.47

### Start i3 from startx 

Copy the default xinitrc to your user profile.

```text
 cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc 
```

Edit the file and add "exec i3" after the line that imports xinitrc-common, and before the line that runs the default Xclient.

The system stops processing the file when it reaches the first exec command.  It will run i3 and then stop.  Ensure the xinitrc-common is still called as it is needed to get dbus working.

### Moving to next and previous workspace

This is not a default binding, but we can add it to the config:

```text
bindsym $mod+comma workspace prev
bindsym $mod+period workspace next
```

### Turn off window titles

```text
new_window 1pixel
```

### Control window border colours.

* border is the border colour for the title bar
* indicator is the colour of the line that appears to the side of the window, showing where the near window will be created.
* child_border is the border colour for the window.  (indicator seems to appear ontop of this border)

```text
# class                 border  bground text    indicator child_border
client.focused          #000000 #000000 #FFFFFF #232323   #232323
client.focused_inactive #000000 #000000 #FFFFFF #000000   #000000
client.unfocused        #000000 #000000 #888888 #000000   #000000
client.urgent           #000000 #900000 #FFFFFF #000000   #000000
client.placeholder      #000000 #000000 #FFFFFF #000000   #000000
```


### Naming workspaces

If you want to name workspaces, do it like this:

```text
set $ws1 "1:www"
set $ws2 "2:terminal"
set $ws3 "3:sublime"
set $ws4 "4:webstorm"
bindsym $mod+1 workspace $ws1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace $ws2
bindsym $mod+3 workspace $ws3
bindsym $mod+4 workspace $ws4
bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move container to workspace $ws1
bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace $ws2
bindsym $mod+Shift+3 move container to workspace $ws3
bindsym $mod+Shift+4 move container to workspace $ws4
```

### Run items during startup

Run scripts during i3 launch by adding them to the bottom of the config.

The exect/nostartupid/exec thing prevents the wait cursor spinning.

```text
exec --no-startup-id exec synclient TapButton1=1
exec --no-startup-id exec compton
exec --no-startup-id exec feh --bg-scale '/home/ms/wallpaper/night_sky_snow-wallpaper-1366x768.jpg' 
```

### Transparency

i3 doesn't support transparency, but we can get some by installing "compton".  Run compton from the bottom of the i3 config, and then gnome-terminal transparency will work. 

### Wallpaper

Set a wallpaper at the bottom of the config file.

```text
exec --no-startup-id exec feh --bg-scale '/home/ms/wallpaper/night_sky_snow-wallpaper-1366x768.jpg' 
```

### Adding apps to dmenu

If you want an app to be available in the Win+D search, add it somewhere in PATH.  A good place is ~/bin

### Customising i3 status-bar

The position, colours and executable for the status bar are set in the general i3 config file.  E.g. ~/.config/i3/config says:

```text
# Start i3bar to display a workspace bar (plus the system information i3status
# finds out, if available)
bar {
	colors {
		background #000000
		statusline #00A5FF #that neon blue
		separator #666666
		focused_workspace  #4c7899 #285577 #ffffff
		active_workspace   #333333 #5f676a #ffffff
		inactive_workspace #333333 #222222 #888888
		urgent_workspace   #2f343a #900000 #ffffff
	}
	status_command i3status
}
```

The i3status executable simply returns the collected status parameters specified in its configuration file.

To turn off the status bar entirely, comment this whole section out.

### Firefox fullscreen

In about:config set full-screen-api.ignore-widgets=true

This unlinks the fullscreen command so that you can make the window fullscreen without losing the tabs.

### Rofi

Rofi is a quick launch menu that can replace dmenu.

Install it with:

```text
dnf install rofi
```

Set it into i3 config with this command:

```text
bindsym $mod+d exec rofi -show run -dpi 180
```

Use shift+right and shift+left to change between the run and window modes.  Or you can run in "combined" mode like this:

```text
rofi -combi-modi window,drun -show combi -modi combi -dpi 180
```

You can select a theme by running:

```text
rofi-theme-selector
```

Preview the themes and select one by pressing ALT+A.  The selected theme is then saved into ~/.config/rofi/config.

### Notifications

dbus is the message queue thing that lets applications send notifications to each other.  It needs to be running.

dunst is a notification daemon, it listens for messages and pops up a window to display them.  It can be installed from dnf/yum.  dunst has a config file at ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc, which can be used to customise its behaviour and appearance.

notify-send is the command to send a notification for dunst to display.

To send a message with a title and a body:

```text
notify-send "Hello" "Marc was here"
```
