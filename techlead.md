# Being the Tech Lead


## Thinking time

* Our job is to think, but there's never any thinking time in the calendar.  We have to force this in ourselves.
* Thinking time is not wasted time, it might be the most productive time.


## Design

* Learn the landscape of all platforms that are being used.  Ideally learn the code too.
* Design the way components talk to each other.  Get the interfaces right and things can't go too badly.
* Have a solid idea of what you want.


## Peer review

* When peer reviewing, review the output from the code before reviewing the code itself.
* Peer reviewing during screen share is fast.  Doing that is enough to begin with.
