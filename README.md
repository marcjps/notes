# Notes

Marc is on a mission to learn just about everything, but right now is looking at modern javascript, node.js, .net core, java, pretty much every type of database, cloud, everything interesting that can be done using Linux, and even wants to catch back up with C/C++.  Not much then..

These are notes about things.
